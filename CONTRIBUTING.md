# Contribution Guide
Welcome to the repository of the front-end of the self-tuning gui project. This guide will explain how this repository works and how to contribute.

## GitHub
### Issues
GitHub issues is a place to report bugs, request features, and ask questions. When something comes up (ideas, bugs, etc.), record the it in issues for everyone to keep track of.

When creating an issue, please follow the template. If you are reporting a bug, please include steps to reproduce the bug. If you are requesting a feature, please explain why you think the feature is necessary. If you are asking a question, please explain what you have tried and what you are confused about.

### Pull request
Pull requests (PR) are a way to contribute to the project. Changes should always be made through a PR (excepting when I'm building out the project because I'm lazy).

Here is how to use pull request:
- Create a branch (or fork if you don't have write access)
- Make changes
- Create a pull request
- Wait for review (other contributors will help review your code)
- Merge
- Delete branch

This ia a way to ensure only quality and functional code gets into the main branch.

### Actions
Github actions is a way to automate the process of testing and building the project. When you create a pull request or make a commit, the action will run the tests and build the project. If the tests fail or the build fails, the pull request will not be merged. We will also be using actions to automatically test for performance issues as we will need to keep this project light weight.

### Project
The project tab is a place to keep track of the progress of the project. It is a place to keep track of what needs to be done and what is being worked on. It is also a place to keep track of the progress of the project.

## Tooling
### Vite <a>https://vitejs.dev/</a>
Vite is a build tool that is used to build the project. It packages in a lot of the tools that is needed to produce a production ready modern website. It also has a dev server that allows for fast development along with many other features like an effective build tool.

### React
This project uses React as the front-end framework. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is a component based framework that allows for easy and fast development because of its modularity and virtual DOM. It is also a framework that is easy to learn and use. This is the library I'm most familiar with.

### TypeScript
TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It is also a language that is easy to maintain and scale because of it's static typing.
